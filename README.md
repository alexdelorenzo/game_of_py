game_of_py
==========

i woke up at 6am on a sunday and had nothing better to do than write this.

versions
========

game_of_py.py conforms to the test spec
gol.py and pyglet view can be run in pypy for a decent framerate

retrospective
=============
+ writing tests made fleshing out code for a simulation i was unfamiliar with easy
+ had to discern what operations on data accrued what performance penalty really for the first time in a project
+ the above led to learning about profiling modules and different python implementations
+ modelling data in a heavy OO way is resource intensive, conforming to tests without that constraint hindered the scripts performance
